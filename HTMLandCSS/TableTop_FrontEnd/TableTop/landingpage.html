                <h1>What are Tabletop Games?</h1>
                <p>Tabletop games are games that are normally played on a table or other flat surface, which include board games,
                tabletop role-playing games (TRPG), and miniature war games. The games are either cooperative or competitive,
                with many variations in complexity between them.</p>

                <h1>What are Euro Board Games?</h1>
                <p>Euro Board games are developed from war game simulation used in the military which simulates real-life situations
                with various factors to consider. Euro board games make players consider all possible factors with little to no luck
                during the game.</p>

                as their characters. They encourage imaginative storytelling, language skills, and teamwork between players.</p>
